## Notes
Connecting to github and recording was the challenge. Actual building is pretty simple and cool!

## App Brainstorming

  cool app 1: bleach brave souls
              - full fledged game with amazing graphics 
              - online play with intuitive controls
  cool app 2: capital one
              - easy fingerprint security no pass needed
              - much better UI than pc website and easy to use
  new app: Something cool to build would be an app that lets people with similar lifestyle/outlook/hobbies to meet up and form social groups with boards/chats/community events. Alot of apps have this ability but this app would be entirely focused on getting people together to interact in real life and reduce the loneliness epidemic we have. The goal is to bring back the regular social interaction and scheduled group activities people had in high school to make an excuse to spend time together. Maybe a bad idea to make an app that aims to get people to stop using devices so much :)
